        <h2>CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>

            browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing
            DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other
            mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online
