                    Getting client approval on creative visuals has always involved lots of back and forth - for
                    both designers and project managers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tiny Note is a Free Design Feedback Tool that lets you upload visuals, invite as many people as you want,
                    have all the notes on the visuals in one place, track your uploads, get the client approval, and
                    move on to the next job.

                    The last thing anyone wants is to upload visuals in yet another online drive, or send yet
                    another email attachment in a sea of attachments. Both can get messy and difficult to track.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tiny Note help designers and project managers handle client correspondence as easily as drinking
                    a glass of water. It's free and no login or registration is required.
